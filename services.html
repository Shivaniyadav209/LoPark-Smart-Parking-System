                <h2 style="color: blueviolet;">REAL TIME PARKING AVAILABILITY</h2>
                   <p> <li>Real-time parking availability is a service offered by a smart parking system using LoRa technology
                    that enables drivers to quickly and easily find an available parking space. This service works by
                    using sensors that are installed in each parking space to detect the occupancy status. The sensors
                    are connected to a LoRaWAN gateway, which collects and transmits the data to the central server.</li>
                    <li>The central server processes the data and provides real-time parking availability information to
                    drivers through a mobile app or a website. This information can include the number of available
                    parking spaces in a particular area, the location of available parking spaces, and the type of
                    parking space available (e.g., handicap accessible, EV charging, etc.)</li> 
                    <li>By providing real-time parking availability information, drivers can save time and reduce stress by
                    avoiding the frustration of searching for a parking space. They can also reduce their carbon
                    footprint by reducing the time and fuel wasted in searching for a parking space. Parking operators
                    can also benefit from this service by optimizing the use of parking spaces, reducing congestion, and
                    increasing revenue.</li> </p>
                <p> Overall, real-time parking availability is a key service offered by a smart parking system using
                    LoRa technology that can improve the parking experience for drivers and increase efficiency for
                    parking operators. </p>

                <!-- <p>The system can also provide guidance to drivers on the nearest available parking spot based on
                    real-time availability data. This can help reduce traffic congestion and make it easier for drivers
                    to find parking quickly.</p> -->
                <p><li> Parking guidance is a service offered by a smart parking system using LoRa technology that helps
                    drivers find available parking spaces quickly and easily. This service uses a combination of
                    sensors, LoRaWAN gateways, and a central server to provide real-time information on parking
                    availability and guidance on how to get to an available parking space.</li>

                    <li> The parking guidance service works by installing sensors in each parking space to detect the
                    occupancy status. The sensors are connected to a LoRaWAN gateway, which collects and transmits the
                    data to the central server. The central server processes the data and provides real-time parking
                    availability information to drivers through a mobile app or a website.</li>

                    <li> In addition to real-time parking availability information, the parking guidance service can also
                    provide turn-by-turn directions to an available parking space. This is achieved by using GPS and
                    mapping data to guide drivers to the nearest available parking space. The directions can be
                    displayed on a mobile app or an in-car navigation system, providing a seamless and stress-free
                    parking experience.</li></p>

                <!-- <p>With a smart parking system, users can pay for parking using a mobile app or other digital payment
                    methods. This eliminates the need for physical payment methods like coins or credit cards and makes
                    the payment process more convenient.</p> -->
                <p><li>Automated payments is a service offered by a smart parking system using LoRa technology that enables
                    drivers to pay for parking without having to interact with a payment terminal or an attendant. This
                    service uses a combination of sensors, LoRaWAN gateways, and a central server to detect when a
                    vehicle
                    enters and exits a parking space and to calculate the parking fee based on the duration of stay.</li>

                    <li> The automated payments service works by installing sensors in each parking space to detect the
                    occupancy
                    status. The sensors are connected to a LoRaWAN gateway, which collects and transmits the data to the
                    central server. When a vehicle enters a parking space, the sensor detects the occupancy status and
                    starts a timer. When the vehicle exits the parking space, the sensor detects the vacancy status and
                    stops the timer. The central server then calculates the parking fee based on the duration of stay
                    and
                    other factors, such as the type of parking space and any special promotions or discounts.</li>

                    <li> Drivers can pay for parking using a mobile app or a payment terminal. The mobile app can be linked
                    to a
                    credit card or a prepaid account, and the parking fee can be deducted automatically. The payment
                    terminal can accept cash or credit card payments, and it can issue a receipt or a ticket.</li>

                    <p> By providing automated payments, a smart parking system using LoRa technology can reduce the time
                    and
                    hassle associated with paying for parking. It can also reduce the need for on-site personnel to
                    collect
                    payment and issue tickets, which can lower operating costs for parking operators.</p></p>

                <p><li> Maintenance and monitoring is a service offered by a smart parking system using LoRa technology that
                    enables parking operators to remotely monitor the performance and status of the system and perform
                    maintenance tasks as needed. This service uses a combination of sensors, LoRaWAN gateways, and a
                    central server to collect and analyze data on the system's performance and identify potential issues
                    before they become problems.</li>

                    <li> The maintenance and monitoring service works by installing sensors in each parking space to detect
                    the occupancy status. The sensors are connected to a LoRaWAN gateway, which collects and transmits
                    the data to the central server. The central server can then analyze the data to identify trends,
                    patterns, and potential issues that may require maintenance or repair.</li>

                    <li>The maintenance and monitoring service can also provide real-time alerts to parking operators if
                    there are any system failures, such as a sensor malfunction or a communication outage. This can help
                    operators quickly identify and resolve issues, reducing downtime and minimizing disruptions to the
                    parking system.</li>

                    <li>In addition to monitoring the performance of the sensors and gateways, the maintenance and
                    monitoring service can also monitor the status of the payment system, the mobile app, and other
                    components of the parking system. This can help operators ensure that the system is functioning as
                    expected and identify any issues that may be impacting the user experience.</li>

                    <p> By providing maintenance and monitoring, a smart parking system using LoRa technology can improve
                    the reliability and uptime of the system, reduce the need for on-site maintenance personnel, and
                    minimize the impact of downtime on users. This can ultimately lead to a better overall parking
                    experience for drivers and increase revenue for parking operators.</p></p>
